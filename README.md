## Introduction

### Problem statement

Our goal is to identify the effects of political spending on federal contract awards before and after the Supreme Courtâ€™s decisions in Citizens United and SpeechNow vs FEC.

### Data set

The main dataset of this project has two main sources. 

Federal contractor data is downloaded from:
[USASpending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/#/download_center/award_data_archive)(from 2008-2018)

Campaign contribution data is scrapped from:
[OpenSecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/methodology.php)

## Analysis

### Data cleaning

We merged the datasets with some novel techniques and created multiple unique features for this analysis. For explanations on the methodology, see Mod3_Project_JG_PW.ipynb 

### Exploratory data analysis

We seek to answer 3 main questions in this project: 
1. Have federal contractors made more campaign donations since Citizens United?
2. Do federal contractors w/ PAC donations receive more contract awards?
3. Do federal contractors donate a larger share to Democrats than non-contractors?
4. Do federal contractors make the same amount of campaign contributions as non-contractors?
